- There are two datasets in the "data" file

- Some R codes in "code" file:
	- main.R: the main program of the simulation
	- estimation.R: the implement of the estimation algorithm
	- loss_calculation.R: the implement of the calculation for the loss function (including reweighed loss function)
	- utils.R: other necessary functions for the algorithm
	- real_data_analysis.R: the application of the algorithm
